Na√Øve Bayes Classifier is a probabilistic classifier and is based on Bayes Theorem. Given a new data point, we try to classify which class label this new data instance belongs to. The prior knowledge about the past data helps us in classifying the new data point. Below is the Formula of Bayes Theorem, based on which Bayes Classifer works.
